## Assignment Feedback
The assignment was a practical and relevant exercise for a Data Engineer role. It covered key aspects of the job:
- **Data Ingestion**: Handling large CSV files and ensuring data integrity.
- **Database Modeling**: Translating raw data structures into a relational schema.
- **Data Validation**: Writing SQL logic to find discrepancies between disparate systems.
- **Communication**: Summarizing technical findings into a readable report.

The datasets were appropriate in size to test optimization strategies (chunking) without being prohibitively large for a local environment.

## Duration
- **Time taken**: Approximately 2-3 hours.
    - 1 hour for setup and schema design.
    - 1 hour for ingestion and comparison logic.
    - 0.5 hours for reporting and documentation.

## Frontend
A simple Markdown report was chosen as the output format (`report.md`) for clarity and portability. No separate frontend was built, as the primary focus was on the data engineering pipeline.

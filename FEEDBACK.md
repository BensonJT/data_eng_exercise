## Assignment Feedback
The assignment was a practical and relevant exercise for a Data Engineer role. It covered key aspects of the job:
- **Data Ingestion**: Handling large CSV files and ensuring data integrity.
- **Database Modeling**: Translating raw data structures into a relational schema.
- **Data Analysis**: Writing SQL logic to find discrepancies between disparate systems.
- **Communication**: Summarizing technical findings into a readable report. Producing a PowerPoint presentation to demonstrate how the results can be communicated to an executive audience.

The datasets were appropriate in size to test optimization strategies (chunking) without being prohibitively large for a local environment. It did take my local environment however many hours (8+) just to ingest the millions of records from the CSV files. 

## Duration
- **Time taken**: Approximately 28 hours. Many hours were spent resolving storage and system issues in my home environment that the scope of the project surfaced. But I also produced a tremendous amount of code and documentation as well.
    - 4 hour for setup and schema design.
    - 8 hour for ingestion and comparison logic.
    - 16 hours for analysis, reporting and documentation.

## Frontend
There are two reports. The most user friently version is report.html. 
The report.md has essentially the same content.
A PowerPoint presentation was created to summarize the findings and recommendations.
And there is a PDF file of the PowerPoint presentation.

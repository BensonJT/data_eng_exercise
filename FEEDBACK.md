## Assignment Feedback
The assignment was a practical and relevant exercise for a Data Engineer role. It covered key aspects of the job:
- **Data Ingestion**: Handling large CSV files and ensuring data integrity.
- **Database Modeling**: Translating raw data structures into a relational schema.
- **Data Validation**: Writing SQL logic to find discrepancies between disparate systems.
- **Communication**: Summarizing technical findings into a readable report.

The datasets were appropriate in size to test optimization strategies (chunking) without being prohibitively large for a local environment.

## Duration
- **Time taken**: Approximately 20 hours.
    - 1 hour for setup and schema design.
    - 3 hour for ingestion and comparison logic.
    - 16 hours for analysis, reporting and documentation.

## Frontend
A powerpoint presentation was created to summarize the findings and recommendations.
